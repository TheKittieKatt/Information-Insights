Dual Fan Wiring Guide

This guide works across many tool heads.   Dragon Burner, Rapid Burner, Yavoth, and almost any that have a single body cowl system with the dual fans on both sides.    This does not work quite the same for AntHead.  As the sides containing the fans are separate pieces from the center.  So, you will have to go over the top of the center mounting with that tool head. 

The first dual part cooling fan tool head I tried was Dragon Burner.  It seemed like a pain and super complicated to wire up.   That and on my EBB36 there were only 2 fan ports, and I needed to connect 3 fans.   This led to me spending some time thinking about the best way to wire both part fans together into 1 connector.    Do I run wires up both sides and connect near the top or try to join them closer to the fans?     

After some thinking and tinkering, I figured out that I could run the wiring for the one side through the inside of the tool head near the LEDs that light up the part.   I also figured out that if I did this running the fan wire from the right side (if looking at it from the back and the top away from you) that the wire came out the hole in the side going into the middle of the tool head perfectly with no pressure on the wiring going into the fan.    

I also figured out that if I ran my hot end cooling fan out the right side, my part cooling fan would come out the left.  Now I never have to struggle with which is which when working on the tool head later.   

I hope this guide is helpful!

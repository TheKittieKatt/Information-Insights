#About Me

When I first started 3D printing, I had no plans to get into modifying printers and having to mess with firmware etc.   

The only problem with this idea was I bought a Sovol 6 as part of the release sale, and I was in the second wave of shipments.   Well, it showed up with a bent hot end from the factory.   So that was the first thing I learned was installing a new hot end.    

In the 6 months after that I learned much more, as the printer had a TON of issues.   I ended up beta testing firmware that allowed the printer to bed mesh properly, as stock firmware did not, as well as a few other things.  I tested several mods for fixing the part cooling issues the printer had.   The bed thermistor wiring broke inside the insulation as they used 3 strand wire that was brittle and thin.   So, I got to make a new one with better quality wire.   There were several other major failures, but the coupe de gras was the day I started a print and the tool head started smoking and tried to catch fire!!  

That was the last straw for me, and I said screw it, I’m building a Voron!  Me being me, I wanted to build the nicest one I could from the start.   So right away I went all in with Canbus (there were almost no good guides at the time, so I had to get info to make it work from like 6-8 sources), titanium backers on the gantry, larger touch screen, and a few other things.    My first Printer was Princess Peach.   

After about 6 months I built a second Printer, Sombra.   She got all the same upgrades as Peach did from the start.  

I started with StealthBurner (SB) with clockwork 2 for the extruder on both printers.  When G2 extruder kits launched I immediately got a couple.   I then had SB with g2e in them.   

As time went on, I started trying various things, especially tool heads.   I was having troubles deciding what tool head I wanted to try, so I ended up trying a bunch of them.   The one I wanted to be amazing was the XOL2.   The hype and all that was wild, and I knew it had to be amazing.   Man was that a let down when it had worse accels than my SB.  The only thing it did better was cooling.   Other than that, it was a giant monstrosity that required you to swap to narrower front idlers because the tool head was so wide (this being acknowledged by the devs when I spoke to them) it would crash into standard idlers.   I went on to try Rapid Burner (RB), Dragon Burner (DB) and fell in love with them for how light and small they were.   I tried one or two others around this time, but I have forgotten what they are now.    I ended up converting all my printers to DB or RB.   

Around this time I started to be known for my two printers because they stood out.   And I was getting better at many things and had written a guide and tried a lot.   This led to me being invited to beta test some stuff, as well as be part of a couple of dev teams.  (Mainly for documentation and testing as I was not that great with CAD at the time.)  

Later there were as few new tool heads I wanted to try, and I needed one that supported a cutter as LDO gifted me a Box Turtle to try.   This led to me trying the AntHead and its cutter variant LeafCutter.    In my search, I saw a few others that had me curious.  
 
Over the last couple years, I have done my best to help people starting out by providing some honest input from my time in 3D printing.  Sadly, many times there is always that one person that “knows it all” and must argue with you about things they do not have firsthand knowledge in.   Like the one individual that wanted to argue that XOL2 is smaller and lighter than DB.   When in reality XOL2 is larger and heavier, but as they have an obsession with that tool head they could not just let this person asking for help get help, they had to hijack the post to rant about XOL2 being the best, smallest, lightest, and blah blah blah tool head in the world and that nothing out there could possibly be better. 

This incident turned into a discussion with a friend about creating a source of information that would settle it all once and for all.    Use a set of calipers to measure the tool heads and weigh them on a quality scale and do an honest comparison of as many as possible.   

This led to a conversation with LDO and they were kind enough to offer me a discount on the parts needed to build this informational repository.

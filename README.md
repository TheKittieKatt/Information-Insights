#Information & Insights

I decided to make a repo with information on various things from my time doing 3D printing.   This is a collection of guides I have made, data from testing I have done, and anything else I think someone may find helpful.        

If you are questioning why I would do this.   Well I had a rough start in 3D printing and while I had a couple of friends that helped me a lot, there were times I was left having to figure out a lot for myself.   I always appreciated it when I found a quality source of information that was helpful.   So, I decided to try to make a source to help others.

So I hope this information is helpful!

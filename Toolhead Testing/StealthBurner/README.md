Like many of us the StealthBurner was the first toolhead I ran on my printer.   I used this for a while, but at some point, the bug got in me that I wanted something better.   While Stealth Burner has been a gold standard for years, there are now toolheads that are just smaller and lighter with better part cooling. 

There is nothing inherently wrong with this tool head, it is just one of the heaviest toolheads currently being run on Vorons.   And as you may know, weight (as well as a few other factors) lead to poor accelerations, which means lower printing speeds if you are trying to also keep your prints clean.   

If you predominately print in ABS and such you will probably not see the part cooling difference as much as if you were printing in PLA or something that does like to cool much faster.

Assembly notes.   If this is your first time building this tool head be sure to follow the manual as when it comes time to assemble the face plate it can be tricky the first time if you donâ€™t have any instructions.    Another note on assembly, is when putting the face plate on be very careful and pay attention to where the pins are.  If the pins are in the wrong places, it could just mean your fans not working right, or it could fry your boards depending how far off you are.

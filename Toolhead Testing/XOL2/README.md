My first time using this tool head was right after it was released.  The mounting system was a nightmare, and I immediately noticed how wide it was.   This is the widest toolhead I have come across to date.   It is about 20mm wider than most other toolheads out there.   In getting the current version of the tool head, I will give credit to the developers in updating the mounting system.  It is much better than it was.    

I do think it is worth mentioning that this tool head was not designed for using with fans originally.  It is a CPAP tool head.   And from what I understand the only reason there is a fan version is people continually asking the dev team for one.    

Also be aware you will have to replace your front idlers to use this tool head as it will crash into stock Voron front idlers.   While I do support and love the narrow idler mods such as BFI, I find it silly that you have to do this to use a tool head because it is soooooo wide.   

I do have to give the devs credit though as they did put lots of tie down points for cable management which I always appreciate.   

I do also think it is worth mentioning, before their repo stated you had to change your idlers, I reached out to ask about the tool head crashing into the stock ones.  The reply I got was very curt and basically stating that Voron front idlers were crap and should be replaced anyway and they did not care.   They were fully aware of it.

Assembly notes There are a lot of odd ball parts you will need like m2.5 screws and such.   Be sure to make sure you have all the parts needed on hand before tearing down your old tool head or you may find yourself waiting on parts before your printer is running again.

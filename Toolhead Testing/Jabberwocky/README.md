Jabberwocky is a full tool head solution.  Designed from the ground up it has many unique features and addresses many minor issues various extruders have in attempt to make something new and with fewer issues.     I had the pleasure of beta testing this tool head and I must admit I was impressed by the results I was getting out of it.    While it is mainly geared towards MMU applications, it works wonderfully as a standard toolhead as well.    

The tool head is not one you would self-source as there are a couple of custom parts inside.   The plus side to this though, is that the kit will be sold with everything needed to build the toolhead.    From what I have worked out pricing wise on tool head building it seems to be very affordable as well.   Especially considering the kit contains a hot end, 3 fans, pre-soldered LEDs, extruder kit, all needed hardware, and night hawk toolhead board.   All you will need is the printed parts to assemble it.    

I have done a more in depth write up in my Beta testing section of my repo if you wish to learn more about the tool head.   You can also check out the information straight from the designers at their repo linked at the top. 



Part Cooling Fans:  3010 Blower Fans x2

Assembly notes:   I was very impressed that the developers took the time to make tools to assist with ensuring that the bearings were installed smoothly and evenly.    The tool head is also designed to be very tight tolerances.   If you are struggling with print quality, you may have some issues assembling this tool head.

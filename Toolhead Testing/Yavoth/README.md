I think this may be my new favorite tool head to recommend to people wanting to do their first new tool head.   While there is no manual it is pretty straightforward as there is just a main body and possibly a spacer depending on your hot end.    I think it is also worth mentioning this is one of the smaller and lighter tool heads out there as well.

Assembly notes.   The LDO 2510 fan was super tight to try to press in.   

I have found a trick that works well on most of these dual part cooling fan tool heads.   If you wish to see what I do feel free to check here:

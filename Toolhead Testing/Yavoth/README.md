I think this may be my new favorite tool head to recommend to people wanting to do their first new tool head.   While there is no manual it is pretty straightforward as there is just a main body and possibly a spacer depending on your hot end.    

What you will need to assemble this tool head:

Part Cooling Fans:  4010 Blower Fans x2

Hot End Cooling Fan:  2510 Axial Fan x1

Logo Led:  None

Part Led:  Neopixel x1

3x m3 Square Nuts (DIN 562 preferred)

3x m3x10 SHCS/BHCS screws

Small Zip Ties x2 (or more if you are like me and like your wiring super organized)

4x hot end mounting screws (revo used m3x12)

1x m3x12 & 1x m3x14 (to mount g2ww extruder)

40mm Bowden tube (trimmed down to fit)


Assembly notes.   The LDO 2510 fan was super tight to try to press in.   

I have found a trick that works well on most of these dual part cooling fan tool heads.   If you wish to see what I do feel free to check here:

I have run this tool head on my printers for a long time now, as well as the UHF variant, Rapid Burner.   These have become my go to toolheads since they were the smallest and lightest toolheads I have found to date (3/20/25).   

One thing I love about Dragon Burner is that I can build it at my work bench and then mount it after with just a few screws.  This lets me get my wiring super clean and makes working on the tool head easy.   This is not the case with the Rapid Burner, as it has to be put together in steps. 
  
I will say though I recently discovered the Yavoth and it is almost the same size and weight, but easier to print and assemble as it is a one part body design.   If you are not comfortable with the multi-part body design of Dragon Burner or Rapid Burner I would highly recommend looking at the Yavoth.

Part Led:  Neopixel x2


Assembly notes.   Take the time to build this at your bench top and get it nice and clean as it just takes a few bolts to mount it so you can have all your wiring 98% done.  

I have found a trick that works well on most of these dual part cooling fan tool heads.   If you wish to see what I do feel free to check here:

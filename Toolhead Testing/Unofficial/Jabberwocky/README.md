I was fortunate enough to be part of the beta testing team for this toolhead, so the unofficial results reflect the results I got with the beta test kit and different filaments from the official testing.    The official results will be posted soon, but the write-up is already in place.  

I do have to admit, when I was invited to the beta testing circle, I was skeptical when they told me this was something special.   I have tried many toolheads over the years.   Many of them at first launch with a lot of hype about being the next greatest thing.   Though VERY few have lived up to that.   I must admit, this tool head was great!   The last toolhead to get me excited like this was going from StealthBurner to Dragon Burner.

Rapid Burner is similar to the Dragon Burner, it is just taller to give room for UHF hot ends.   Another notable difference is that while you can just bolt on a DB after building it, for RB you will have to assemble it in steps when mounting it.    

Up to this point (3/20/2025), I have not found a lighter and smaller tool head for UHF hot ends.     I have run this toolhead for over a year now with no issues and wonderful results.   While not the easiest to assemble or simplest of designs, it does function very well once assembled and working.    

Part Cooling Fans:  4010 Blower Fans x2

Hot End Cooling Fan:  2510 Axial Fan x1

Logo Led:  Neopixel x1

Part Led:  Mini Neopixel x2

Assembly notes Take the time to clean up your wiring and such at a bench top work area, you will get better results.  Once you have everything sorted out there you will have to disassemble the tool head and mount it part by part.       

I have found a trick that works well on most of these dual part cooling fan tool heads.   If you wish to see what I do feel free to check here:

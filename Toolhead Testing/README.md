#Tool Head Testing

At this time this repo of information is still a work in progress and will be for a while.  I will be adding more tool heads as I  have time to build and document and as well as when I can afford to.  I havbe plans to start the repo with about 12 tool heads, but it is just getting started.   You may find empty folders for various extruders or tool heads etc.  That is because it is on my list to add to the repo, but I have not completed that item yet.  Please bear with me while I get this put together.   

While LDO has been kind enough to sponsor this project to help offset some of the costs I am still out of pocket on a lot of this project to provide this information to everyone.    If you can afford it and the information helped you out and you would like to see this repo continue to grow, feel free to donate to the cause.    https://buymeacoffee.com/thekittiekatt

I have done my best to keep all testing fair and even across all tool heads.    There will always be slight variations you cannot account for.   So please take this information as the guide to help compare tool heads it was designed to be, and understand this data is not being used to launch rockets to mars.  If you would like full information on the method to my madness for this comparison, please feel free to check over the CYA folder of this repo.    If you would like more detailed information about a tool head you can go to the folder for it.   

Now that we have all the formalities out of the way letâ€™s get into the meat and potatoes of it all.

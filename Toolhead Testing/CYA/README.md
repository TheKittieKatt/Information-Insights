I feel like an explanation to the method in the madness of how I am doing all my testing should be given.   Everyone has their own configurations for how they assemble their tool heads.  I wanted to be sure that I am being as fair as possible with this testing.   Therefore, I have done my best to keep everything even across the board.   Here are the parameters for my testing.  

Every tool head is printed in the same LDO Blue ABS and LDO Orange ASA

Unless a tool head specifically is designed for a different hot end, I have used a Revo Voron with a 40w core and .4 nozzle that is brand new so there is no filament in it.   

Since there are a ton of different configurations of electronics, I chose to use an ebb 36 for the tool head board, unless the tool head specifically needs a different board.    I also did not put any LEDs, limit switches, or any kind of Z probing devices on any of the tool heads.   I did put in the hot end fan and part cooling fans, all LDO stock fans.   This was for a couple of reasons.   First, it kept everything balanced.  Second, it was less work for me to do setting them up.    

While there are many mounting solutions for most tool heads, I have chosen to use the stock mounting that was designed by the tool head developers for this testing.   In some cases, I may do some mounting comparisons that will allow you to compare CNC mounting to the printed parts.

I do need to address an elephant in the room.   Manufacturers tolerances.  Every part that is manufactured by any means may have slight variations.   

Since I had a ton of heat sinks, heater cores, and nozzles on hand I did weigh them all individually.  

The blue and grey heat sinks ranged from 6.7g to 6.9g, except the red one I had laying around, it was 7.2g.    I will do my best to always use blue ones, but if needed I may use grey as it fell in the same weight range as blue.   

The nozzles I weighed were all 7.0g to 7.1g.  

Heater cores came in at 10.4g to 10.7g.  

So, if we take all this information, we can see that the hot end can vary by .6g alone.   

I did prebuild several of my g2ww extruders for this project and weigh them.   They were about 158.7g to 159.2g.   So, we see another .5g ish range there as well.  

Now if we get into filament densities, you will find that they all vary a little.   This is why I chose to use the same two colors for all the testing.     This is why all the g2ww will have the same color patterns and why I will always try to print mounting brackets in the same filament as well.   This should help keep everything as even as possible. 
 
So, if you decide to try to replicate my findings and you are off by 1 to 2 grams.  Donâ€™t freak out and start saying my testing is off, this tool head is 2 grams heavier!!   That is within the realm of just manufacturing tolerances and filament density differences.  

This is not meant to be an end all be all source, but more of an unbiased guide to help people decide on a tool head if they are having trouble deciding.   

I did include images in this folder showing weights of parts.   I did weigh more than just what is shown here in many cases, I did not get pictures of everything.

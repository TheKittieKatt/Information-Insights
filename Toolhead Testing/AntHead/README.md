When I first saw this tool head I loved it, the unique design of it looks amazing!   While it is kind of a pain to set up and work on, I did not mind it much once it was all set up and running as it just looks great.   

It is not that difficult overall, but what makes it tedious is that you cannot bench-top build your tool head and bolt it on.   You mount the base, then a plate, then the hot end, then the ducts, then the extruder.   And if you need to work on anything you must do the whole process in reverse while all your wires are still attached making it a mess.   

I feel bad like I am ragging on this toolhead, but I do love this tool head.  It looks amazing and while it is a little heavier and larger than a couple of other options, it does print well.   Aesthetically, probably my favorite tool head!   Function wise, it gets the job done!   

Part Cooling Fans:  4010 Blower Fans x2

Hot End Cooling Fan:  2510 Axial Fan x1

Logo Led:  Neopixel x1

Part Led:  None

Assembly notes.   LOTS of parts that all tie into each other, not fun to work on if you need to work on the tool head for any reason.   Make sure you leave a little extra slack in the part cooling fan wires as it will make putting the ducts on easier later.  

I did have to alter the carriage mount to add limit switch mounting and had to modify the plate to have zip tie points while I built this.   As of the time of the testing of this tool head, these donâ€™t seem to be a thing.   I did upload the files for these and you can find them here.

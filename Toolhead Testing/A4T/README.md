I honestly thought this tool head would be smaller and lighter based on the pictures I saw of it.    This tool head is about 15mm wider than most modern toolheads.  It also requires you to change from stock idlers to narrow idlers, like the BFI mods.    While these are nice mods to do and I support the upgrade of the idlers, having to do it because the tool head I super wide seems silly when most modern tool heads will work with stock Voron idlers just fine.

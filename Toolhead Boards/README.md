Toolhead Boards

Originally, I was not going to make a comparison of toolhead boards, but as I ended up with a few in my hand I figured it does not take much to weigh, measure, and gather a little information on each one.

Most of the information will be pretty generic in nature, if you want full details you will want to look at the manufacturerâ€™s information.   
I will be breaking this down into two different areas.   Boards for StealthBurner and boards that are made to mount on the back of the extruder.

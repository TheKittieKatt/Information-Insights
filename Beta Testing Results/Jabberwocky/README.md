I had the opportunity to beta test Jabberwocky.  This is a complete tool head solution, as in you use their body and extruder.   I was pleasantly surprised by the results.   I have used several hot ends and extruders over the years and have got good results with most.   But this toolhead sets itself apart from most in a few ways.  

The first thing that I fell in love with when I was done assembling this, even before trying it, was the magnets instead of a spring for the filament cutter.   This was a huge quality of life upgrade to me.

Once I started doing some testing, I was happier with this toolhead.   My first few prints came out very clean even with almost no tuning.    My standard test print is usually a Calicat.   Within a few prints and adjustments, I was able to get down to 27 minutes and keeping the print quality just about perfect.    

I have also spent a lot of time discussing the toolhead with the designer.   One of the main topics being the ongoing debate between dual gear or single gear extruders and which is better.   It seems like with almost every dual gear extruder on the market they use a grub screw to contain one gear.   This can lead to small artifacts in your prints because the gear can end up off balance or wobbly.  Basically, acting like an unbalanced tire on a car.   This is   Hence why there is an argument for single gear extruders as they do not have these small artifacts, but they are not as good at getting even pressure on the filament for feeding.   Thus, the back-and-forth debate.    This extruder was designed to address all this.  It is a double gear extruder, but it does not have a grub screw capturing it.   So, it does not have artifact issues but keeps the more even filament feeding.  

This tool head will be sold as a kit requiring printed parts.   You will want to be sure your print quality is on point when printing the parts for this as the tolerances are very tight on a few things.  Or if you are going to pay someone to print parts for you be sure their quality is top quality.   The kit is supposed to come with the hot end (Conch), extruder parts, fans, toolhead board (Night Hawk 36), and all the other misc. wiring and such you will need. 

I ran this tool head for about 3-4 weeks before its launch and thus far have had no issues.

Some of the main features of the tool head as described by the creators are:

LDO Orbiter Gears are the source of the gears, but what differs is obviously the lack of planetary gears.  It comes with dual LDO non-threaded nano-coated Orbiter gears. What this means is that there are no grub screws in them but uses the same peek sleeve bearings that is found from the original.  This also differs from the original stainless-steel gears, as the newer gears are nano-coated. 

Bondtech Compound Drive Gears, although it is found in the LGX Extruder, this gear is merely a compound drive gear.  It is more like the IDGA for BMG extruders, so it is being referred to as Bondtech Compound Drive Gear.  Though the LGX uses two completely different gears for the idler gears. 

Five Gear Extruder Similar to LGX Extruders, Hexadort, and many of current and latest extruders employ this over the traditional direct axle drive gear motor. The benefit is a combination of this layout and the dual idler gears. This layout benefits in more contact surface with the filament yet still able to load and unload repeatedly/consistently. There are other aspects that are currently proprietary, and this five-gear layout has been specifically designed for this kind of performance.  JW uses an 8-spur gear driven by an LDO pancake motor and provides a well-balanced torque and speed for this gearing combination.

LDO Dual idler gears (non-threaded).  There is much debate over single gear vs dual idlers. Many have tested both and found similar quality and performance. The big difference with JW is that it does not have a grub screw. A similar problem was found in BMG based gears before the introduction of the IDGA/RIDGA drive gears. This is because of the offset created by a grubscrew, would create artifacts. Because JW does not have this in its design, it will not have those artifacts. This does position it a little uniquely against other extruders because of this.  Fully utilizing the benefits of dual idler gears that gives it even pressure on both sides of feeding the filament which in turn creates more stability for the print experience. 

Magnetic Filametrix Cutter is based off filametrix but has been designed specifically for JW.  It utilizes magnets instead of springs, has Lunette (flanged bearings - support holes for cutter), and has an increased fulcrum distance to the full-sized unaltered blade.  These are the various improvements made to make cutting consistent and clog free. 

Flip up Extruder.  Probably an industry first, a tool-less easy to access toolhead design so that one can access the blade or the filament path for servicing and troubleshooting. This allows a user, in the event of hopefully a rare problem during a filament changing print the ability to access the filament path to clear it of issues and continue with a print job.  I do not believe there is a design out there that can offer this kind of serviceability on the fly. The double hinge design is both designed to make this very stable, but also a very accurate registration for the filament path and cutter. This is one of the signature features of the toolhead. 

Phaetus Conch Hotend has been specifically selected to pair with this toolhead. Although JW can use other hot ends with some modifications, this toolhead is specifically selected because of its performance and its unique cooling system.

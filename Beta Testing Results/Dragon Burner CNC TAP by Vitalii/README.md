Dragon Burner CNC TAP by Vitalii

April 2024 

Vitalii reached out to me to beta test a CNC TAP for Dragon Burner.   I had used his CNC TAP for StealthBurner and it worked wonderfully.   I was starting to go away from SB to Dragon Burner and told him I would love to test it.    

I found it just as easy to install as the CNC TAP for Stealth Burner (half the unit is the same).   Almost all the printed parts were the same as well.   When I made the swap from SB with TAP to DB with TAP I gained about 800 on my accels.    And my print quality was great.   

I ran this set up on my machine for almost a year (11 months) and never had any issues.   I consistently had good print quality.   

I also ran this on a second machine when Vitalii began to do anodizing.   He was again kind enough to give me a set that was anodized blue to try out as he was just starting to anodize.   I ran this set for many months with no issues as well.   

Not long after starting the beta testing for this, Vitalii felt he was not getting much positive feed back as half the people that got test kits did not bother to give their testing results, so he never put this into full production.    I have told him it is an amazing product, and he stated if he gets enough requests for it he will more than likely bring it back and put it in production.   So, if you are interested in one check his site or reach out directly to him.

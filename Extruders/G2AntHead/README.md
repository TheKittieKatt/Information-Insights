AntHead Extruder

![Alt text](https://github.com/TheKittieKatt/Information-Insights/blob/main/Extruders/AntHead/IMG_4606.JPG)

This is a modified g2ww extruder adding in two micro switches and ball bearings that act as filament run out sensors.   One is near the top and one is near the bottom.    This is wonderful for MMU builds.   While it is a little heavier than a g2ww or g2sa, it does allow you to put 1 or two run out sensors directly in your extruder thus not needing an external one, cleaning up your build.  

Sometimes the wiring for these switches can be a pain to set up cleanly, so I made a short guide showing how I have been doing mine.    This has worked well for me as well as a few other people.

I have also modified this to close the hole at the bottom of the extruder if you only need one switch.    As well as modifying the rear body to remove the bit that comes down and is specifically for this tool head, allowing it to be mounted on any tool head you desire that will take a standard g2ww.  This allows you to use this extruder for say a Yavoth or DragonBurner Tool changer build or just about anything.   The modified files can be found here.

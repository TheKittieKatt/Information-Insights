#Extruders

Originally this was just going to be information on the g2 extruder variations.  But, as LDO was kind enough to donate an Orbiter 2.5, I figured I can add information for other extruders as well.  As I gather data about various extruders I will add that information to the repo.   

Please keep in mind that there are a ton of different extruders out there now with more released all the time.   There are a few functioning similarities between them and far more differences.    Some will be more accurate with more micro steps giving you cleaner prints.   Others have faster motors and fewer micro steps meaning they will push plastic faster but be less accurate.   

I am focusing more on physical attributes such as weight and size here and I suggest doing some homework into the extruders you are trying to decide between to see what will work best for your needs.  I did include some of the information on the drive style and such, but if you want further information, I do highly recommend going to the creatorâ€™s site to get full information on their project.  I have also made folders for each extruder with further information as well as pictures from testing and such as well.

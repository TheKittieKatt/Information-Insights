AntHead Extruder Modified

![Alt text](https://github.com/TheKittieKatt/Information-Insights/blob/main/Extruders/AntHead/IMG_4606.JPG)

I have modified the AntHead Extruder to close the hole at the bottom of the extruder if you only need one switch.    This should help with possible snags when feeding in filament. 

I have also modified the rear body to remove the bit that comes down and is specifically for this tool head, allowing it to be mounted on any tool head you desire that will take a standard g2ww.  

I have found that combining both changes makes a extruder with a run out sensor built in and works great on any tool head that allows you to use a g2ww.
